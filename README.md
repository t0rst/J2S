## J2S â€” Yet another Java to Swift Converter
Torsten Louland, Satisfying Structures BVBA


<!-- ### TOC -->



### Aims
J2S aims to do 60-80% of the conversion work for you. It is far from perfect, and it is not a goal to become perfect. Instead, it gets you over the initial conversion hurdle, from which point you use a mixture of manual and automated conversion, as suggested in [Workflow](#workflow).


### Make
<!-- fetch & install pre-requisites, and build  -->


### Use
<!-- params -->


### Workflow
<!-- assume git; repo branches: JavaAsSwift, J2S, dev; copying across changes, reconverting & cherry picking deltas -->
